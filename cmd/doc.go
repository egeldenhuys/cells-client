DESCRIPTION
  This command automatically generates the documentation of the Cells Client.
  It produces nice Markdown files based on the various comments that are in the code itself.

  Please, provide the '-p' flag with a path to define where to put the generated files.

  Also note that this command also generates the yaml files that we use for pydio.com documentation format.
